#Tumblr API jQuery Plugin

##Usage:
 
	$( "target jQuery object" ).getTumblrPosts( "your tumblr API key" );

For information on the Tumblr API and/or to get your tumblr's API key, visit http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2.

Style the mark-up noted below however you wish.

Current configuration options:

postsPerPage - int = fairly self explainatory.
pagination - boolean = turns on/off pagination functionality and UI for pagination.
currentPage - int = indicates which page will be displayed first.
loading - HTML as string = accepts any HTML to be displayed while the request is loading via AJAX.
previousBtn / nextBtn - string = inner HTML for next and prev buttons created for paging if pagination is enabled.

More configuration options will probably be available soon, as well as a more modular design.

The end.

##Mark-up

This plugin creates A LOT of mark-up for the developer, 
so the following notes quickly explain some of the mark-up used:

All individual posts' containers have the class 'post' plus a post-type specific class:
'text-post', 'audio-post', 'video-post', 'quote-post', etc.

	Ex. <div class="post text-post">...

	Posts' converted timestamps are in <p class="post-date"> elements.

###Text posts
	
A typical text post will be marked up something like:
	
	<div class="post text-post">
		<h2>Hello World.</h2>
		<p class="post-date">8/1&nbsp;2011&nbsp;11:41AM</p>
		<p>What√≠s up, Tumblr?</p>
		<a href="http://atumblrblog.tumblr.com">Go to tumblr post...</a>
	</div>

------

###Photo posts - 
	
Photos that are in posts with > 1 photo get the class 'multi-photo' on their containing element.
This allows for different styling, sizing etc via CSS between single and multiple photo posts.

Photo sizes are conditionally selected based on their original size -
If the original photo is > 500px width, then a smaller 500px width photo is used,
otherwise, the original size is loaded. All photos link to their original size.

A typical photo post will marked up as follows:
	
	<div class="post photo-post">
		<p class="post-date">8/1&nbsp;2011&nbsp;11:51AM</p>
		<div class="tumblr-photos">
			<figure>
				<a title="" target="_blank" href="http://photo-url.jpg">
					<img src="http://photo-url.jpg">
				</a>
				<figcaption>Photo caption</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</div>
		<p>Photo post text.</p>
		<a href="http://atumblrblog.tumblr.com">Go to tumblr post...</a>
	</div>

Now that you have an idea of the mark-up, it should be relatively easy to decipher the other post types :)
Firebug can uncover any other secrets for you.
